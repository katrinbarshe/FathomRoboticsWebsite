            <div class="text-body">
              An all-in-one marine autonomy computer that combines compute, autopilot, positioning, and system integration into a rugged platform for unmanned surface vessels. It replaces multi-device setups with a unified architecture that simplifies installation and improves reliability. Designed for professional USV operations, the platform supports autonomy workflows from research to commercial deployment while remaining flexible for custom software, sensors, and vessel configurations.

            <div class="text-body"> 
              A versatile marine CAN interface that bridges legacy and modern systems, supporting multiple operating modes from protocol translation to full autonomy and autopilot integration. It enables real-time data exchange between vessel systems while remaining control-system agnostic, and is designed for reliable operation in harsh marine environments. The platform eliminates vendor lock-in and provides browser-based telemetry, diagnostics, and piloting through a zero-install web interface.

            <div class="text-body">
              A fail-safe wireless emergency stop system designed for robotics, autonomous platforms, and industrial machinery where hardwired safety controls are impractical. It allows operators to maintain immediate safety control from a distance, automatically halting equipment during emergencies, signal loss, or system faults. Built for demanding industrial environments, the system adds a robust safety layer with continuous monitoring, clear operator feedback, and flexible integration into mobile and stationary machinery workflows.
